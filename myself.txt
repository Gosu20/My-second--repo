My name is Ananya, and I am an enthusiastic and determined learner with a passion for exploring new ideas. I enjoy challenging myself and pushing boundaries to grow both personally and professionally. I am curious by nature and always eager to understand how things workâ€”especially in areas like technology and coding. I believe in staying consistent, being creative, and never giving up, no matter how tough a task may seem. In my free time, I enjoy reading, solving problems, and learning new skills. I strive to make a positive impact and am excited to keep evolving on this journey.
